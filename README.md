# js-example

This is my own flavour of skeleton example to work with javascript project.
Whats in it are:

- Editorconfig
- Eslint
- Husky

## Getting started

- Clone or download from https://github.com/reekoheek/js-example
- Go to the directory
- Remove `.git` directory, since you want to use your own repo,
- Init your own git
- Modify package.json to your specific project values
- Don't forget to `npm i`

or

```
git clone https://github.com/reekoheek/js-example myapp
cd myapp
rm -rf .git
git init
npm i
```
